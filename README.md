# Simple Heart Drawer

**Simple Heart Drawer** is a Python script that uses the Turtle graphics library to draw a heart shape on the screen. Developed using Visual Studio, this project showcases basic graphics programming with Python.

## Features

- Draws a heart shape using Turtle graphics.
- Customizable colors and drawing speed.
- Simple and easy-to-understand code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Visual Studio** with Python support installed.
- Python 3.9
- Turtle graphics library (usually included with Python)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** or **download** the code:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/literallyawildhog/simple-heart-drawer.git
   ```

2. **Open Visual Studio** and **load the project**:
   - Launch Visual Studio.
   - Go to `File` > `Open` > `Project/Solution` and select the `simple-heart-drawer` folder.

3. **Set up the Python environment**:
   - Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed and configured in Visual Studio.
   - Configure the Python environment by going to `Tools` > `Options` > `Python Environments`.

4. **Run the script**:
   - Open the `main.py` file in Visual Studio.
   - Press `F5` or click the `Start` button to run the script.

### Usage

- **Run the script** to see a heart shape drawn using Turtle graphics. The script opens a window where the heart is drawn slowly.

### Code Overview

The script includes the following components:

- **Turtle Setup**: Initializes the Turtle graphics window and settings.
- **`draw_heart()` Function**: Draws a heart shape using Turtle graphics commands.
- **`slow_draw()` Function**: Calls `draw_heart()` with a delay to slow down the drawing.
- **Customization**: You can change the colors, background, and drawing speed in the code.

### Example

When you run the script, you will see a Turtle graphics window where the heart shape is drawn as follows:

- **Background Color**: White (customizable).
- **Heart Color**: Black (customizable).
- **Drawing Speed**: Adjustable.
